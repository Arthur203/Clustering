# Clustering
K-means Clustering: The code uses the K-means algorithm to cluster the Iris dataset into three clusters based on Euclidean distance.
Data Preparation: It loads the Iris dataset and initializes the KMeans model with 3 clusters.
Model Fitting: The model is fitted to the data, and the cluster centers and labels are obtained.
Visualization: The clusters and their centroids are visualized using Seaborn and Matplotlib, including a confusion matrix and an elbow plot to determine the optimal number of clusters.
